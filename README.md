# 👋 Hi, I'm Sam Zhang

I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Toronto, passionate about backend systems, AI, and building cool tools that work. I’ve built scalable microservices, full-stack apps, real-time bots, and GPU-accelerated image filters — all from the ground up.

I'm currently contributing to an AI startup, refining my Develop->Ship->Iterate skills, and always looking for new opportunities to grow as a developer.
